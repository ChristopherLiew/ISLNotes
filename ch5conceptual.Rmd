# Question 1

Let $Var(X) = \sigma_X^2$, $Var(Y) = \sigma_Y^2$, $Cov(X, Y) = \sigma_{XY}$, we have:
$$
Var(\alpha X + (1 - \alpha) Y) \\
= \alpha^2 \sigma_X^2 + (1-\alpha)^2 \sigma_Y^2 + 2\alpha(1 - \alpha)\sigma_{XY}
$$
See section *Basic properties* of [Variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) for reference.

Its differential to $\alpha$ is 0 at minimum:
$$
2\alpha\sigma_X^2 - 2(1 - \alpha)\sigma_Y^2 + 2\sigma_{XY}(1 - 2\alpha) = 0 \\
(\sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2 - 2\sigma_{XY}) \alpha = \sigma_Y^2 - \sigma_{XY} \\
\therefore \alpha = \frac{\sigma_Y^2 - \sigma_{XY}}{\sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2 - 2\sigma_{XY}}
$$
which is the same with equation (5.6).

# Question 2
## 2a
The probability of the first bootstrap observation is not the *j*th observation from the original sample is $\frac{n-1}n$.

## 2b
The probability of the second bootstrap observation is not the *j*th observation from the original sample is $\frac{n-1}n$, too. Because the observation is selected with replacement.

## 2c
The probability that the *j*th observation is not in the bootstrap sample equals to all $n$ bootstrap observations are not the *j*th observation from the original sample.
The possibility of each selection is $\frac{n-1}n$, so the possibility of all $n$ selections is $(1 - \frac 1n)^n$.

## 2d ~ 2f
When n = 5: $1 - (1 - \frac15)^5 = 0.672$

When n = 100: $1 - (1 - \frac1{100})^{100} = 0.634$

When n = 10000: $1 - (1 - \frac1{10000})^{10000} = 0.632$

## 2g
```{r}
n <- 1:100
pibs <- function(x) 1 - (1 - 1/x) ^ x
plot(n, pibs(n), type = 'l')
```

Function $1 - (1 - \frac1n)^n$ is converged to 0.632.

## 2h
```{r}
store=rep(NA, 10000)
for(i in 1:10000) {
  store[i] <- sum(sample(1:100, rep=TRUE)==4) > 0
}
mean(store)
```

This probability is converged to 0.632, too.
