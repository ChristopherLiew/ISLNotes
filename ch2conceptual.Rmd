# Question 1

(a) better: more data points make flexible method more accurate;

(b) worse: flexible method tend to be overfit on less data points;

(c) better: flexible method is more suitable in non-linear situations;

(d) worse: high variance of error terms make flexible method overfit;

# Question 2

(a) Regression, inference, n=500, p=3;

(b) Classification, prediction, n=20, p=13;

(c) Regression, prediction, n=52 (how many weeks in 2012), p=3;

# Question 3
(a) See fig 2.9 for pattern of training MSE and test MSE when flexibility increase. See fig. 2.12 for pattern of variance, bias and test MSE when flexibility increase.

# Question 5
For prediction, use flexible method, with enough observations to avoid overfit.

For inference, use a less flexible approach, while the bias may be high.

# Question 7
(a) $3, 2, \sqrt{10}, \sqrt5, \sqrt2, \sqrt3$

(b) Green, for the minimum of results in *(a)* above is $\sqrt2$

(c) Red, for there are 2 *Red* (for Euclidean distance = 2 and $\sqrt3$) and 1 *Green* (for it = $\sqrt2$)

(d) Small, because small K is more suitable for non-linear problems.
